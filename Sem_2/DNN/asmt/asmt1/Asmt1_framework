Architecture of Deep Learning (including the number of layers, types of layers, activation functions, and any unique features)


CNN:
Transfer learning on VGG16 CNN and Resnet50 pretrained on colour camera images
	-13 convolutional layers used:filter size 3x3, stride 1, padding 1
	-Initial image size 224x224x1 (grayscale) - to all 3 channels
	-5 padding layers after each convolutional layer: Window 2x2 stride 2
	-Last 2 layers - trainable : 
		--Global Average Poolng and 64 neuron dense layer with dropout
	-Activation function: ReLU
	-Final: Classification layer - sigmoid
Same for both VGG16 and ResNet50 models



How is the network helping the overall task? eg: feature engg or classification or regression or all  

Training procedures (e.g, training strategy, including optimization algorithms, learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization techniques)

Trainable layer : Dense layer with 64 neurons and dropout
- Optimisation algorithm: RMSProp
- lr : Cyclic learning rate used,  with Base learning rate= 0.0001 and Max learning rate= 0.001.
- Loss Function: Binary cross entropy
- 10 Fold cross valdation
- Snapshot ensemble used: 7 snapshots taken after 90% accuracy is reached. Average score gives class


Evaluation / Performance metric

Covid classification problem, Chest xray images
train: 102 covid, 102 pneumonia (68 viral, 34 bacterial)
test: 33 covid, 208 pneumonia, all compressed with 0.9 quality


A: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
B: https://radiopaedia.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=covid&scope=all&lang=us
C: http://www.sirm.org/en/


6% false positive rate, worse than other methods
limitations: small number of cases available 
	the lack of information on what stage of disease the chest X-rays are from
	the lack of informationon outcomes 
	the reduced resolution of the COVID-19 images
